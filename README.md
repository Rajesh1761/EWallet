### Guides
### Using an IDE
I recommend that you work with your Java code using an IDE that supports the development of Spring Boot applications such as **Spring Tool Suite** or **IntelliJ IDEA Community | Ultimate Edition**.

All you have to do is fire up your favorite IDE -> open or import the parent folder EWallet, and everything will be ready for you.
